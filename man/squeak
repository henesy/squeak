.SH SYNOPSIS

.B run_squeak
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Squeak
starts the Squeak interpreter, with 
.I image_file
as the main image. The directory of the
.I image_file
should also contain a changes file and a sources file which were downloaded with it.

The
.I run_squeak
command will download the current stable Squeak image and sources files to $home/lib/squeak_image, and then invoke the interpreter appropriately. If image files already exist, the script will simply invoke the interpreter.
